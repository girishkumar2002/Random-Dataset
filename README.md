# Linear Regression Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of linear regression using synthetic data. The analysis involves generating random data, fitting a linear regression model, and evaluating its performance. The Python code uses libraries such as `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `scikit-learn`.

## 1. Imports and Data Generation

The necessary libraries are imported, and random data is generated with added noise to create a dataset for linear regression.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

np.random.seed(6)
x = np.random.rand(100, 1)
noise = np.random.randn(100, 1)
y = 3 * x + 2 + noise
2. Data Visualization
The data points are visualized, and a linear regression model is fitted to plot the regression line.

python
Copy code
plt.scatter(x, y, s=10, label='Data points')
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('y')

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(x, y)
y_pred = model.predict(x)
plt.scatter(x, y, s=10, label='Data points')
plt.plot(x, y_pred, color='red', linewidth=2, label='Regression line')
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('y')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
3. Model Coefficients
The intercept and coefficient of the linear regression model are printed.

python
Copy code
print(f"Intercept: {model.intercept_[0]}")
print(f"Coefficient: {model.coef_[0][0]}")
Intercept: 1.9831814499541787
Coefficient: 2.8959913323938604

4. Model Training and Evaluation
The data is split into training and test sets. A new linear regression model is trained, and the performance is evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared metrics.

python
Copy code
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score

xtrain, xtest, ytrain, ytest = train_test_split(x, y, train_size=0.85)
model1 = LinearRegression()
model1.fit(xtrain, ytrain)

print(model1.coef_)

ytrainPred = model1.predict(xtrain)
ytestPred = model1.predict(xtest)
mae_train = abs(ytrain - ytrainPred).mean()
mae_test = abs(ytest - ytestPred).mean()

print("Mean absolute error - Train:", mae_train)
print("Mean absolute error - Test:", mae_test)
Mean Absolute Error - Train: 0.6168685283109145
Mean Absolute Error - Test: 0.8127135402694939

python
Copy code
r2_train = r2_score(ytrain, ytrainPred)
r2_test = r2_score(ytest, ytestPred)

print("R2_train:", r2_train)
print("R2_test:", r2_test)
R2_train: 0.4717245704757873
R2_test: 0.3960887997300999

Conclusion
The linear regression model demonstrates a basic fit to the data, but there is room for improvement as indicated by the R-squared values and mean absolute errors. Future work could involve tuning the model or using more complex techniques to enhance performance.
